# User Guide

## Background

The Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF) has developed an advanced product toolbox (TBX) capable of conducting Radiometric Terrain Correction (RTC) with Sentinel-1 data named S-1TBX RTC. The toolbox provides automated fetching of data from ASF's datapool (https://vertex.daac.asf.alaska.edu), Digital Elevation Map (DEM) selection and stitching, and bundles the European Space Agency's Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) toolbox with a recipe for processing RTC products from start to finish. This allows users to begin with a single granule name and in one command produce RTC analysis ready Sentinel-1 end products.

Distortions in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery are induced by the side-looking nature of SAR sensors and are compounded by rugged terrain. RTC corrects geometric distortions that lead to geolocation errors by moving image pixels into the proper spatial relationship with one another based on a DEM. RTC removes the misleading influence of topography and backscatter values, combining both corrections to produce a superior product for science application and analysis.

## Output Products
- GeoTIFF image with 
    - 30 meter pixel spacing
    - Pixel values indicate gamma-0 power
    - Projected in Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates
- ArcGIS compatible ISO 19115 metadata

   ```
   curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh
   ```
1. Create a docker group and add your user to it
   ```
   sudo groupadd docker
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```
1. Log out and log back in for the group change to take effect
1. Start Docker
   ```
   sudo service docker start
   ```
1. To verify everything is working run the docker command
   ```
   docker run hello-world
   ```
   Confirm you see the following in your output
   ```
   Hello from Docker!
   This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
   ```
1. Download **s1tbx-rtc.sh** to the directory where RTC products should be saved

   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asfadmin/grfn-s1tbx-rtc/master/scripts/s1tbx-rtc.sh
   ```
### macOS

1. Download the [Docker for Mac](https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg) installer (~500 MB)

1. Run the Docker for Mac installer by double clicking Docker.dmg, then drag Moby the whale to the Applications folder

   <p align="center"><img src="images/drag_and_drop.png" width="75%"></p>

1. Double-click Docker.app in the Applications folder to start Docker.  This will take a few moments.  When complete, "Docker Desktop is now up and running!" should be displayed.

   **Note:** A Docker ID is not required.

1. Download [**s1tbx-rtc.sh**](https://asfdaac.s3.amazonaws.com/s1tbx-rtc.sh) to the directory where RTC products should be saved

## Usage

1. Find the name of the GRD or SLC granule to process from [Vertex](https://vertex.daac.asf.alaska.edu/).
   
   *The examples below use S1B_IW_GRDH_1SDV_20190430T161529_20190430T161554_016038_01E295_771B*.

1. **macOS only:** Run the Terminal app to open a command line window and navigate to the directory where **s1tbx-rtc.sh** is saved

1. Execute **s1tbx-rtc.sh** with the granule name and desired options
   ```
   sh s1tbx-rtc.sh --granule S1B_IW_GRDH_1SDV_20190430T161529_20190430T161554_016038_01E295_771B
   ```
   Processing can take up to several hours depending on the granule, internet connection, and computer resources

1. Upon completion, RTC products will appear in the directory where **s1tbx-rtc.sh** was executed
   ```
   S1B_IW_GRDH_1SDV_20190430T161529_20190430T161554_016038_01E295_771B_VH_RTC.tif
   S1B_IW_GRDH_1SDV_20190430T161529_20190430T161554_016038_01E295_771B_VH_RTC.tif.xml
   S1B_IW_GRDH_1SDV_20190430T161529_20190430T161554_016038_01E295_771B_VV_RTC.tif

   ```
## Additional Options

```
